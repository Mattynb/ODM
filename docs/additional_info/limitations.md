# Limitations

This document outlines some of the potential limitations associated with the method proposed in the paper.

## Dependence on Dataset Quality and Quantity

The robustness and reliability of the proposed outlier detection method hinges significantly on the quality and quantity of the source dataset. Biases, inaccuracies, or insufficiencies in the dataset can potentially undermine the accuracy and efficiency of the system. Thus, the selection and preparation of the dataset necessitate meticulous attention.

## Subjective Bias in Image Selection

The undesirable images were identified based on consensus-driven user studies involving a panel of nine participants. Such a selection process is potentially susceptible to subjective bias in classifying an image as low quality. A broader and more diverse participant pool might be instrumental in mitigating this bias and achieving a more objective classification of image quality.

## Validation with Independent Datasets

The method's validation process seems to employ subsets of the same primary dataset. A comprehensive and robust validation would involve the use of independent datasets of mammograms, which could more effectively assess the method's generalizability and applicability.

## Comparisons to Other Methods

While the proposed method was juxtaposed against 26 unsupervised outlier detection algorithms, a comparison with supervised methods or even human evaluation might provide more comprehensive insight into its performance. It is essential to assess its effectiveness against various benchmarks for a thorough understanding of its capabilities.

## False Positives and False Negatives

The potential for false positives (high-quality images misclassified as low-quality) and false negatives (low-quality images that go undetected) was not explored in-depth in the paper. These scenarios could have significant ramifications in a clinical setting and should be thoroughly considered when deploying such a system.

## Lack of Clinical Validation

The study primarily revolves around the technical performance and algorithmic efficiency, without drawing a direct correlation to clinical outcomes. It would be beneficial to determine whether the enhancement in data quality delivered by the proposed system translates into better cancer detection rates or improved patient outcomes.

## Adaptability to Other Types of Medical Imaging

The study focuses specifically on mammograms. The adaptability and applicability of the proposed method to other kinds of medical imaging remain unaddressed. This limitation could potentially curtail the scope of the paper's applicability.
